Now, let's break down these advanced concepts with their more nuanced aspects:

1. Closures: Practical Applications
   - The module pattern uses closures to create private state, demonstrating how closures can be used for encapsulation in JavaScript.

2. Hoisting: Temporal Dead Zone
   - While `var` declarations are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`, `let` and `const` declarations are hoisted but not initialized, creating a Temporal Dead Zone.

3. Lexical Scope and 'this'
   - Regular functions have their own `this` context, while arrow functions inherit `this` from their surrounding lexical scope.

4. Recursion: Tail Call Optimization
   - Tail call optimization can prevent stack overflow in recursive functions by reusing the current stack frame instead of adding a new one.

5. Higher-Order Functions: Composition
   - Function composition allows you to combine multiple functions to create more complex operations.

6. Currying: Partial Application
   - The `curry` function demonstrates how to create a curried version of any function, allowing for flexible partial application.

7. Memoization: With Complex Input
   - This memoization example shows how to handle complex inputs (like objects) by stringifying the arguments to create a unique cache key.


These advanced concepts showcase the depth and flexibility of JavaScript. They allow for powerful patterns like metaprogramming, functional programming techniques, and fine-grained control over object behavior and asynchronous operations.
