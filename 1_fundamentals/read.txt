I've created an artifact with detailed examples and explanations for the fundamental concepts in JavaScript. Let's go through each section:

1. Variables and Data Types:
   - We cover the three ways to declare variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`.
   - Examples of all primitive types are shown: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, and bigint.
   - An object is also demonstrated, showing how to create a simple object literal.

2. Operators and Expressions:
   - Arithmetic operators are shown with basic math operations.
   - Comparison operators demonstrate loose equality (`==`), strict equality (`===`), and greater than (`>`).
   - Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) are used in boolean logic examples.

3. Control Structures:
   - An `if...else` statement checks age for voting eligibility.
   - A `switch` statement handles different days of the week.
   - Various types of loops are demonstrated:
     - `for` loop counting from 0 to 4.
     - `while` loop counting to 2.
     - `do...while` loop ensuring the block runs at least once.
     - `for...in` loop iterating over object properties.
     - `for...of` loop iterating over array elements.

4. Functions:
   - A function declaration `greet()` shows basic syntax.
   - A function expression `sayGoodbye` assigns an anonymous function to a variable.
   - An arrow function `multiply` demonstrates concise syntax for simple functions.
   - The `welcome()` function shows how to use default parameters.
   - Function calls demonstrate how to use these functions and what they return.

These examples cover the core fundamentals of JavaScript, providing a solid foundation for understanding more complex concepts. Each example is accompanied by comments explaining what it does.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of these fundamentals, or shall we move on to the next topic?
